# agents4j (simulation)
Framework supporting easy yet powerful implementation of both very basic agents as well as agents with advanced mechanisms for reasoning and representation of knowledge.
The framework is implemented in Java and benefits from Java 8 features such as lambda expressions and functional interfaces but may also utilize native code, where performance is crucial.

* High degree of modularity to enable reutilization, composition and replacement of individual components
* Modern and extendable graphical user interface for executing simulations.
* Optional assembling of simulations from existing components via xml configuration files
